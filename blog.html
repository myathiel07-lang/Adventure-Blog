            <h2>Adventure Awaits!</h2>
            <span class="date">November 28 2023 • by Mya</span>
            <p>
    This hunt quickly became one of my favorite memories. On a cold, quiet morning in my tree stand, 
    I spotted the biggest-bodied 8 point buck I had ever seen. I steadied myself, took the shot, and 
    watched him disappear into the brush.
    <br><br>
    Tracking him was a mix of adrenaline and nerves, but when I finally walked up on him, I couldn’t 
    believe it—my second big 8 point ever, and the largest deer I’ve harvested on my own. Dragging him 
    out and processing the meat felt incredibly rewarding, and bringing home those antlers was the 
    perfect ending to the experience.
    <br><br>
    I named him Chuck, and he’ll always be a hunt I’ll never forget.

            <span class="date">October 2024 • by Mya</span>
            <p>
    This was one of the biggest buck rubs I’ve ever found, and I couldn’t believe it when I walked up 
    on it. The size of that tree and how shredded it was had me fired up, I knew a giant was running around
    that ridge. It’s the kind of sign that instantly makes your heart pick up a little.
    <br><br>
    Fresh rubs like that are the best. They tell you you’re in the right spot, and they make the whole 
    scouting trip feel worth it. Seeing this indicated the rut was on! 
    And it definitely gave me a confidence boost going into the season.

        <h2>Check the Cams!</h2>
        <span class="date">November 2025 • by Mya</span>
        <p>
            Trail cams are one of my favorite tools for learning how deer move through an area. 
            They show you what’s around, when the deer are coming through, and the patterns they follow. 
            This buck meant a lot to me because he was my first real target buck in the U.P.
            <br><br>
            Even though I didn’t end up harvesting him, he’ll always be a memorable part of my 
            hunting story. It was my first hunt in the U.P., and seeing him pop up on camera made 
            the whole experience exciting and special.

        <p>
        This tale starts with taking my cat, Gin, out scouting with us! 
        She absolutely loves being outside and always wants to tag along.
        This spot was extra special because it was my very first time scouting and hunting St. John’s Marsh, a place filled with memories for my dad since it’s a popular local hunting area.
        I’m really glad Gin and I got to explore the marsh together and make our own memories there!

<h2> Fishin Shenanigans</h2>
<span class="date"> August 2024 • by Mya</span>
<p>
 We were fishing in a quiet marina when I spotted this bass hanging around the docks. 
    I started messing with him by dragging my lure past his face a few times, just to see if he'd chase it. 
    After teasing him long enough, he finally snapped at it and I snagged him!  
    <br><br>
    Even though it wasn’t a giant, moments like these are what make fishing so fun, just being out on the water, 
    messing around, and never knowing what’s going to bite next.

<h2> Another Successful Hunt!</h2>
<span class="date"> November 2024 • by Mya</span>
<p>
 This hunt was one of those quiet mornings where everything felt peaceful. I watched a small group 
    of does wander in, taking their time, and I just sat there soaking it all in. At first I wasn't thinking about harvesting a doe.
    But the thought of bringing home venison overtook me. Eventually one gave me 
    a perfect, ethical shot, and I was able to make a clean harvest. It was simple, exciting, and honestly one 
    of those hunts that just feels good from start to finish.
    <br><br>
    Every hunt teaches me something new, and this one was no different, another memory I’m grateful for 
    and a reminder of why I love being out in the woods.
